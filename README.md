# Real-Time Location Tracking App ## Overview This application provides real-time location tracking using a combination of Express, Socket.IO, and Leaflet. Users can view live location updates on a map, which is powered by Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. The app leverages WebSockets for real-time communication between clients and the server. ## Features - **Real-Time Location Tracking**: Updates are sent and received in real-time using Socket.IO. - **Leaflet Integration**: Displays live location updates on a Leaflet map. - **Geolocation API**: Utilizes the browser's Geolocation API to fetch and send location data. - **Permission Handling**: Handles geolocation permissions for a better user experience. ## Installation 1. **Clone the repository:** `bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git cd your-repository ` 2. **Install dependencies:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run: `bash npm install ` 3. **Start the server:** `bash npm start ` The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`. ## Usage 1. Open the application in a browser at `http://localhost:3000`. 2. Grant geolocation permissions when prompted. 3. The map will display your real-time location and any other connected users' locations. ## File Structure - `server.js`: The main server file for Express and Socket.IO setup. - `public/`: Contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript. - `css/`: Stylesheets for the project. - `js/`: JavaScript files for client-side functionality. - `main.js`: Contains the logic for real-time location updates and Leaflet map interactions. - `views/`: EJS template files. - `index.ejs`: The main HTML template for the application. - `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies. ## Dependencies - **Express**: Web framework for Node.js. - **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication. - **Leaflet**: Interactive map library. - **OpenStreetMap**: Map tiles provider. ## Contributing Feel free to submit issues, bug reports, and pull requests.
